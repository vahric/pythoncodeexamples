Sometimes you can see that function variables like

def function_name1(var1,var2)

Sometimes we don't know how many we will get then we will use *args

def def function_name2(*args)

Sometimes also not only single and multiple variable we can get dict or key/valu pairs then we will use **kwargs

def def function_name3(**kwargs)
